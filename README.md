# Cook N Count üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Void


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Mihikka S - NSS College of Engineering Palakkad
- Member 2: Vishnu M - NSS College of Engineering Palakkad

### Project Description
Level up your cooking with Cook'n'Count, your pixel kitchen assistant! It automatically counts cooker whistles, runs perfect timers, and generates AI-powered recipes when you're out of ideas. Discover your "personality dish" with our fun food horoscope, chill out with retro chiptunes from the music player, and get instant advice from our friendly AI chef, "Kunjuttan."

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever forgot how many whistles your cooker made while you were busy scrolling memes?
Or maybe you can‚Äôt tell if your rice is ready because you were too busy whistling along?
Exactly. We‚Äôre here to solve this non-problem for you.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We gave your cooker super-hearing.
Our app listens for whistles, counts them, shows a pixel cooker shaking in excitement, and Kunjuttan tells you whether your chicken curry still needs ‚Äúone more toot‚Äù or not.
Oh, and there‚Äôs an alarm ‚Äî because the rice won‚Äôt text you when it‚Äôs done.
